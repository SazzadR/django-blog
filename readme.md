# Django Unchained

Django Unchained is a customized and ready to go Django starter project. It is build upon Django version 2.1. It provides some additional console commands, opinionated structure for project, some level of automation alongside with regular Django goodies. 

Don't be surprised if you find some similarities with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework here. Laravel is a excellent framework which follows convention over configuration that makes developers life easy and development process enjoyable IMHO. So we may get some inspiration from Laravel in this project.

> Please note that this project is still under development and not stabilized yet. We are looking for your contributions to make something useful.
